                <h1 class="title">Regenertion of body to a yuotful state.</h1>
                <p class="first">Human life consists of seven stages in the cycle of development: childhood up to 12
                    years, adolescence up to 24, youth up to 36, maturity up to 42, preparation for old age up to 64, old age
                    up to 84, and deep old age. In total, there are 7 cycles, each lasting 12 years, with variations
                    possible due to physiological and psychological factors.</p>
                <p>Despite our technologies and biohacking efforts, stopping the aging process and death in the modern
                    world has not yet been achieved. Every living creature has its own life cycle. Experiments with stem
                    cells and mitochondria have only slightly increased lifespan, but not significantly.</p>
                <p>The human lifespan is typically limited to 7 cycles set by nature. The primary goal of our project,
                    "Regeneration of Body to a Youthful State," is to slow down, stop, or even reverse the aging
                    processes within the human body. We plan to use cutting-edge technologies to change this cycle. In
                    other words, humans will be able to return to a state resembling childhood. While some animals, such
                    as jellyfish, can achieve this, it has remained an unattainable goal for humans until now. We
                    believe that with our new technologies, this will become possible.</p>
                <p>At the core of all this is an understanding of time as cyclical movement around celestial bodies. On
                    Earth, we have day and night, winter and summer, and our bodies are also subject to cyclic processes
                    inherent in nature. Even in the case of women, who are subject to the menstrual cycle, one can see
                    how the body aligns with the lunar cycle.</p>
                <p>The aging process in the human body has only been stopped by yogis, and the mechanism behind this
                    process is not fully understood. Time spent in meditation and the practice of yoga allows the body
                    to regenerate at the cellular level, as described in ancient texts.</p>
                <p>Our project will focus on changing the influence of celestial bodies on the programmed life cycles
                    within the human body. Each cell has its unique code that genetic engineers are trying to decipher.
                    However, our goal is to influence the cells without altering their DNA, but rather to change the
                    cell's dependence on the passage of time as it has evolved on Earth.</p>
