                <h2>A revolution in space exploration and a new opportunity for alternative energy for the needs of
                    mankind.
                </h2>
                <h3>Relevance and value of the product Space bubbles</h3>
                <p class="first">Having studied a number of scientific papers, as well as having conducted a series of our own
                    experiments,
                    our team came to the conclusion that at this stage of development,science remains at the same place
                    in
                    many
                    areas of astronautics and astrophysics.</p>
                <p>For more than half a century, the conquest of outer space continues to be predominant not only in the
                    scientific but also in the cultural and social paradigm of mankind's quest.</p>
                <p>Having studied a number of scientific papers, as well as having conducted a series of our own
                    experiments,
                    our team came to the conclusion that at this stage of development, science remains at the same place
                    in
                    many
                    areas of astronautics and astrophysics, the key of which are :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>significant energy consumption of most types of engines of modern spacecraft;</li>
                    <li>the absence of real, inexhaustible sources of energy that could be used for both "space" and
                        "earth"
                        purposes;</li>
                    <li>the absence of mechanisms that could ensure the movement of micro-and macro space vehicles at
                        the
                        speed
                        of the solar wind in outer space to other galaxies;</li>
                    <li>lack of effective, practical measures for the destruction of space debris;</li>
                    <li>insufficient preventive effectiveness of modern methods of protecting the Earth from asteroids
                        and
                        other
                        celestial bodies;</li>
                    <li>the limitations of modern space (solar) sails, as well as of other research devices that use the
                        pressure of sunlight or a laser onto the mirror surface to propel spacecraft;</li>
                    <li>lack of proper conditions for creating a thermonuclear reaction on Earth;</li>
                    <li>Material and technical limitations of already existing projects for the creation of research
                        bases
                        and
                        autonomous settlements for human work and life on other planets. Limitations in real projects
                        when
                        creating bases for humans on other planets. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Product novelty</h3>
                <p>It was all of the above that prompted us to create our product â€“ space bubbles,
                    which will greatly simplify the solution of both the mentioned and other problems,
                    in particular, they can be used as an alternative to mirrors for telescopes, as well as
                    to increase the efficiency of other mirror-type space devices.
                    In addition, with the help of our space bubble technology, for the first time in the
                    history of mankind, artificial protection of the planet Mars from radiation can be
                    created. Thus, this large-scale scientific project will allow the creation of an
                    atmosphere on Mars, and, in the future, all other necessary conditions for human
                    life. This means that the space future can be made real already in this century,
                    which is important, given the scale and consequences of man-made, natural, and
                    biological disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
