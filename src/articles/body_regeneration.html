                <h1 class="title">Body regeneration</h1>              
                <p class="first">Human life comprises seven stages of development, each lasting 12 years: childhood up
                    to 12, adolescence up to 24, youth up to 36, maturity up to 42, pre-elderly stage up to 64, elderly
                    stage up to 84, and deep old age. All of us undergo biological and psychological changes during this
                    time.</p>
                <p>Despite our technologies and scientific advancements, we're still unable to completely halt the aging
                    and death process. Our lives have their own natural cycles. Experiments with cutting-edge methods,
                    including stem cells and mitochondria, only marginally extend lifespan.</p>
                <p>The primary goal of our 'Regeneration of Body to a Youthful State' project is to slow, stop, or even
                    reverse the aging processes in the body. We aim to alter the natural cycles of the human body using
                    advanced technologies. Our goal is to return humans to a state resembling even childhood. While some
                    animals, such as jellyfish, can undergo such changes, humans have not achieved this yet. We believe
                    our technologies can make this possible.</p>
                <p>At the core lies an understanding of time as cyclical movement around celestial bodies. Earth hosts
                    various cyclic processes, and our bodies adhere to these laws of nature. Even in the case of women
                    whose cycles are closely related to lunar phases, it's evident how the body adapts to changes in the
                    lunar cycle.</p>
                <p>Halting the aging process in the body has only been achieved by yogis, and we're not yet fully
                    comprehending this mechanism. Meditation and yoga aid the body in cellular-level recovery, as
                    described in ancient texts.</p>
                <p>Our work will focus on altering the influence of celestial bodies on the programming of human cell
                    life cycles. Each cell has its unique code that geneticists are trying to understand. Our aim is not
                    just to alter cells but to change their dependency on time as we know it on Earth. We strive for
                    time control to expedite the regeneration process and alter our response to its passage.</p>
